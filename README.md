Rogue has been a popular video game which all of our group members have tried and enjoyed in the past. We are excited to design and implement a similar game, ChamberCrawler3000 for our final project. From the process of designing and implementing this game, we expanded our understanding of the core principles of Object-oriented programming. Upon completion, we are confident enough to say that our design and implementation perfectly demonstrates polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
